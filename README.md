# 🥬 FreshFlow – Food Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🚀 Project Overview

FreshFlow is a Power BI dashboard project designed to simulate and analyze a retail food supply chain. It helps uncover inefficiencies in inventory management, such as spoilage, stockouts, and product-level profit margins — ultimately supporting better data-driven decisions for store operations and supply chain optimization.

The dashboard was inspired by real-world challenges faced by retailers like Target in managing perishable goods across multiple stores.

FreshFlow mimics this environment by analyzing:
- Product movement across **10 retail stores**
- Sales and spoilage behavior of **20+ SKUs**
- Patterns in **stockouts**, waste, and profit
- Trends over a **two-month sales period**
